## 1. Foundational Pillars

Pillar Theory rests on three emergent principles, ensuring parsimony and consistency:

1. **Existence: Ubiquitous Energy Quanta**  
   All phenomena arise from a continuous, infinitely divisible energy substrate in principle—no voids or separate substances. Effective discreteness emerges from interactions, bounded by scales: Universe-scale horizon (~46 billion ly, encoding global entropy ~10^{122} bits, limiting total addition/dilution) and Planck-scale (~10^{-35} m, triggering local horizons). Forces and matter are excitations in this field, akin to quantum fields but monistic—divisions below bounds create stable structures rather than true atoms.

2. **SpaceTime: Interactions as Fabric**  
   Matter cannot self-alter; change requires pairwise interactions at predictable rates (defining time as integrated change). Conservation (equal/opposite shifts) ensures stability. Space emerges from overlapping interaction graphs, relational and non-absolute.

3. **Change: Density, Direction, and Shape**  
   Energy manifests via density (concentration gradients driving diffusion), direction (vectors relative to peers), and shape (from multi-body freedoms yielding 3D). Superpositions allow overlaps with offset vectors, enabling quantum effects.

These pillars yield a bottom-up ontology: Uniform energy → interactions → spacetime → structured particles/forces.
