# Pillar Theory: Particles as Standing Horizons

A central result of **Pillar Theory** — a monistic unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity via three emergent principles — is that what we call “elementary particles” are not primitive objects but **stable, self-sustaining horizons** formed in the universal energy-quanta substrate when it is compressed below the Planck scale.


## 1. The Planck-Scale Trigger

Any attempt to localize the ubiquitous energy-quanta substrate (Pillar 1) within a region smaller than the Planck length

```math
l_p = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}} \approx 1.616 \times 10^{-35} \, \text{m}
```

requires energy of at least the Planck energy

```math
E_p = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c^5}{G}} \approx 1.22 \times 10^{19} \, \text{GeV},
```

driving the local energy density toward the Planck density

```math
\rho_p = \frac{c^5}{\hbar G^2} \approx 5.0 \times 10^{96} \, \text{kg}\,\text{m}^{-3}.
```

At this threshold the substrate can no longer remain homogeneous: a dynamical boundary — a **horizon** — forms that holographically encodes all internal degrees of freedom on its 2D surface (’t Hooft 1993; Susskind 1995).

Consequence: true point particles and singularities are impossible. Only horizons exist.

## 2. Stability via Topological Resonance (Pillar 3)

Transient horizons evaporate almost instantly through chaotic vector flows (Hawking-like radiation on Planckian timescales).  
Long-lived particles correspond to horizons whose internal quanta organise into **coherent, topologically protected vector loops** (toroidal, knotted, or figure-8 geometries) that minimise free energy.

- Unstable configuration → evaporates in ~ Planck time  
- Resonant configuration → persists ≥ 10³⁴ years (proton-scale stability)

## 3. Effective Scalar Description

We describe local density deviation ϕ from the vacuum expectation value with the relativistic scalar Lagrangian

```math
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} \partial_\mu \phi \, \partial^\mu \phi - V(\phi)
```

and the Mexican-hat potential

```math
V(\phi) = -\frac{\mu^2}{2} \phi^2 + \frac{\lambda}{4} \phi^4 .
```

The vacuum lies at

```math
\phi_0 = \sqrt{\frac{\mu^2}{\lambda}} \propto \sqrt{\rho_p}
```

(spontaneous symmetry breaking tied directly to substrate density).  
Small oscillations around ϕ₀ are harmonic with frequency

```math
\omega^2 = 2\mu^2 = 2\lambda \phi_0^2 .
```

This frequency provides the restoring force that **locks** the horizon radius.  
The particle rest mass emerges as

```math
m \propto \sqrt{\lambda} \, \phi_0 .
```

## 4. Thermodynamics of Micro-Horizons

Every stable horizon — macroscopic or microscopic — obeys the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy formula

```math
S = \frac{A}{4 l_p^2}, \qquad A = 4\pi r_s^2, \qquad r_s = \frac{2Gm}{c^2}.
```

Temperature, evaporation rate, and information content therefore follow directly from black-hole thermodynamics, now applied to elementary particles.
